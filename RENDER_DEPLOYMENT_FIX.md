# Render Deployment Schema Fix

## Problem Identified
- **Local Environment**: `service_prices` table has `display_order` column (working)
- **Render Environment**: `service_prices` table missing `display_order` column (failing)
- **Error**: `column 'service_type' does not exist` was misleading - actual issue was missing `display_order`

## Root Cause
Database schema inconsistency between local development and Render production environments. The `display_order` column was added later but never migrated to Render's PostgreSQL database.

## Solution Implemented
Added automatic schema migration to `server/routes.ts` that:

1. **Checks** for `display_order` column existence on startup
2. **Adds** the missing column if not present: `ALTER TABLE service_prices ADD COLUMN display_order INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0`
3. **Updates** existing records with proper display order values
4. **Logs** the migration process for verification

## Expected Results After Deployment
- Render will automatically detect and fix the missing column
- `/api/service-prices` endpoint will work correctly
- All 11 service price records will be properly ordered
- Platform functionality fully restored

## Verification Steps
1. Monitor Render deployment logs for schema migration messages
2. Test: `https://everyunse.onrender.com/api/service-prices`
3. Test: `https://everyunse.onrender.com/api/debug/schema`
4. Verify all services display correctly on frontend

## Files Modified
- `server/routes.ts`: Added ensureSchemaConsistency() function
- Automatic migration runs on every server startup (idempotent)

## Manual Deployment Required
User needs to:
```bash
git add server/routes.ts
git commit -m "Fix: Add automatic schema migration for Render database consistency"
git push origin main
```

This will trigger Render auto-deployment and resolve the schema inconsistency issue permanently.
